## Report Directory

This is the 'report' directory. 
- It contains 2 document templates (one .docx and one .tex file) for your convenience. The tex file has an associated .bib file to hold references. You can learn about .bib (bibtex) files online.
- You can start with the word doc or the LaTeX document and edit from there. 
- If you prefer some other format (e.g. markdown), feel free to use it as long as a .pdf can be created with that format (e.g. via pandoc).
- The report directory must include at least one (ideally, only one) report pdf 
  file when the project is submitted.
